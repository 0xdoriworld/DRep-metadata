    "motivations": "I believe Cardano represents the next generation, a \"Bitcoin 2.0,\" that fully realizes the core values of blockchain technology in a way no other chain has. Since 2017, I have been a professional in the blockchain space, researching, developing, and operating on various chains. From my technical perspective, Cardano architecture is the truest implementation of decentralization. I am convinced it holds the greatest future potential and I am driven to help make that potential a reality.",
    "objectives": "My objective is to drive the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem and achieve widespread adoption. Cardano stands apart with its unparalleled decentralization, from the network layer to governance, supported by a deeply passionate community. The time is now to effectively bridge its superior technology to users both within and beyond Web3. I will leverage my market experience, technical skills, and trend analysis to spearhead this goal.",

    "qualifications": "As a blockchain engineer at a global company, my experience includes research and development with a Korean blockchain group, as well as designing and operating DApps across different blockchain networks. I have specific experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, contributing to Layer 2 solutions and serving as an official ambassador for Arbitrum. My goal is to leverage this background to help the Cardano ecosystem navigate its future challenges and opportunities.",
